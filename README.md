# UnityDeployLicense
## Integrated with Cryptolens to give Unity application a deploying license.

### This repository aims to integrate the Cryptolens to a full-grown Unity App/Game for deploying. [Cryptolens](https://cryptolens.io/) is an open-source API which licenses your software securely. You may refer to the [Cryptolens docs](https://help.cryptolens.io/basics/index) for a comprehensive understanding of how it works. The quick set up for your Unity software is as following:

- ### Cryptolens Account Set Up
  - #### [Create an account](https://help.cryptolens.io/getting-started/create-account)
  - #### [Create a new product](https://help.cryptolens.io/getting-started/new-product) and [verification key](https://help.cryptolens.io/getting-started/create-license)
  - #### [Create auth/acess token](https://help.cryptolens.io/getting-started/access-token). The Key Lock and the Feature Lock should left blank when you create the token.
  - #### [Get the public key (optional)](https://help.cryptolens.io/getting-started/pubkey)
  - #### Notice that the `Maximum number of machines` when you create the key should be greater than zero, which is corresponding to the `Maximum number of devices` in the customer's editing view. 
  - #### Now you have the `product id`(in the product detail view), `verification key`(20-char string) and the `auth/acess token`. We are ready.

- ### Unity editor Set Up
  - #### Import the [Cryptolens.Licensing.CrossPlatform](https://github.com/Cryptolens/cryptolens-dotnet/releases/tag/v4.0.34) package into the Unity assets. The version I use here is v4.0.34, copy and paste it into the Unity assets. The files we need are `Cryptolens.Licensing.CrossPlatform.dll` and `Newtonsoft.Json`.

  - #### [Registration key script](RegistrationKey.cs/)
    #### Download the script and paste it in the Unity assets. 
    ```C#
    var RSAPubKey = "<RSAKeyValue><Modulus>***</Modulus><Exponent>AQAB</Exponent></RSAKeyValue>";
    var auth = "WyIyMjcxMjQ1IiwiNjV6cWN0VW******QXhUQml2UEt4NUNVY3dIdit4SjkzUXdob0JlbSJd";
    var machineCode = SystemInfo.deviceName;
    var result = Key.Activate(token: auth, productId: 11605, key: "CTRXZ-AQECF-VBSWR-PXNFF", machineCode: machineCode);
    ```
  - #### verification key and auth token set up
    #### Replace the `product id`, `verification key` and the `auth/acess token` in the script with yours.
  
- ### Web API Logs Monitoring
  - ### Key verification status
    #### You can click and review the latest request in the product detail view, if your key verification is successful, you should get the information below:
